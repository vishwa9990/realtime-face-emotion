Among the best practices for training a Neural Network is to normalize your data to obtain a mean close to 0. Normalizing the data generally speeds up learning and leads to faster convergence. Let’s normalize the data before training
Keras Applications are deep learning models that are made available alongside pre-trained weights. These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning. i used MobileNetV2
Trained the model for 25 number of epochs.
